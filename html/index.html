                <p>Sometimes, Internet users land themselves in an uncommon situation where an app or website can be used for both work and personal situations. Well, a young front-end designer was spending up to 13 hours on the site, Codepen for work and
                    her hobby, which unfortunately, is also coding. </p>
                <p>The designer, whose work includes a <em>To-Do Terrarium</em>, clarified, "Well, I didn't <em> have  </em>to use it for work but it was already part of my workflow. It just made sense as it was more efficient." The biggest issue, she said,
                    is that she would hop on Codepen for work, but would get distracted by pens made by others in the community for unexpectedly long periods of time, which then causes her to spend even more time on the site.</p>
                <p> "I mean, that's terrible right?" she asked. Codepen, which brands itself as the best place to build, test, and discover front-end code, has declined to comment at this time.</p>

                    <p>Making a floor Plan with CSS Grid? Talk about using the wrong tool for the job. But I guess this is what happens when someone isn't happy with any of the floor plans found on Pinterest; she'll start making her own for the eventual
                        home that she will never own. Nevertheless, there's a home office with a large window to look out of pensively during rainy days and a ton of "white space" for the cats to run around.</p>

                <p>Trịnh Công Sơn was born in Buôn Ma Thuột, Đắk Lắk Province, Vietnam, but as a child he lived in the village of Minh Huong in Hương Trà in Thừa Thiên–Huế Province.He grew up in Huế, where he attended the Lycée Français and the Providence
                    school. When he was ten he lived with his father in Huế's Thừa Phủ Prison for a year in 1949. Later he went to Saigon and studied western philosophy at the Lycée Jean-Jacques Rousseau, from which he graduated with the baccalaureate
                    degree.

                            <a href="../html/toggle-wrapper.html" target="_blank">the recreation of the Pac-Man layout</a> and <a href="#" target="_blank">coupons inspired by junk mail</a>. A lot of joke items of things that shouldn't be done in CSS Grid,
                            such as <a href="#" target="_blank">a shelf</a>? <a href="#" target="_blank">Bathroom tiles wtf</a>? and <a href="#" target="_blank">makeup palettes </a>. If you are a cultured person, you will have a chance to enjoy a couple
                            of pens inspired by <a href="#" target="_blank">Harry Potter  </a>and <a href="#" target="_blank">Pokemon.</a> On the rare occasion that you are looking at this profile for something you can use in production, you really shouldn't.
                            But, there are <em> some   </em>real-world applications, such as <a href="#" target="_blank">the recipe layout</a>, <a href="#" target="_blank">the product catalog</a>, and <a href="#" target="_blank">color palettes for a style guide</a>.</p>
